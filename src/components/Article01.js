      <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Understanding PDF Parsers</h1>
      <p className="mb-6">
        PDF parsers are tools designed to extract information from PDF
        documents. They are commonly used to read and interpret the content of
        PDFs, which are often complex and contain various types of data, such as
        text, tables, and images. Traditional PDF parsers typically rely on
        predefined patterns or rules to identify and extract data from PDFs.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-6">
        While PDF parsers can be effective for extracting data, they often have
        limitations:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
        <li>
          <strong>Accuracy:</strong> Parsers may struggle with complex layouts
          or poorly formatted documents, leading to errors in data extraction.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Flexibility:</strong> They often require customization and
          tuning to handle different types of PDFs, which can be time-consuming.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Data Cleaning:</strong> Extracted data might require
          additional cleaning and formatting, which can add to the workload.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-6">
        Despite these challenges, PDF parsers play a crucial role in automating
        data extraction processes, especially when dealing with large volumes of
        documents. They help reduce manual effort and increase efficiency by
        converting data into a structured format.
